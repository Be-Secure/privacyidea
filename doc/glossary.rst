   OTP : OTP
   OTP Value : OTP
   OTP Part: OTP
        A one-time password, which is generated by some mathematical algorithm, usually HMAC,
        based on a seed. The term OTP value is used frequently by privacyIDEA to distinguish
        the OTP from the :term:`OTP PIN`.

   OTP PIN: OTP PIN
   Static Part: OTP PIN
        The OTP PIN is the secret password with which the user authenticates against privacyIDEA.
        The policy action :ref:`otppin_policy` sets the type of password. With this
        password privacyIDEA will identify the tokens for which further actions are taken
        (trigger a challenge or check a given :term:`OTP`).
   Seed
        The seed is a secret which is shared between the privacyIDEA server and the client.
        One-time passwords are calculated based on the seed.

   Count
        The token property ``count`` in privacyIDEA is used to calculate the :term:`OTP` value
        using the HMAC-type algorithms HOTP or TOTP.

   Time Step
        The amount of time in which each totp is valid is called a timestep. Possible values are
        30 or 60(seconds), default is 30. If you haven’t used your otp within that window, it will
        no longer be valid, and you’ll need to request a new one to gain access to your application.

   Revoked Token
        Tokens can be revoked. Usually this means the token is disabled and locked. A locked token can
        not be modified anymore. It can only be deleted. Certain token types like certificate may
        define special actions when revoking a token.

   Orphaned Token
        An orphaned token means, that it has a user assigned, but the user does not exist in the
        user store (anymore).
