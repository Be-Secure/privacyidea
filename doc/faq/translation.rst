Setup translation
-----------------

We are using weblate to allow the community to participate in translation.

You can go to https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/privacyidea/ and check, which languages need support.
This is the most important part you can do: Added words and sentences in the right language!

Note, that new languages need to be added to the directive "translate" in the top level Makefile.
Also new languages can be added in the "best match" in ``app.py`` and ``login.py``.
