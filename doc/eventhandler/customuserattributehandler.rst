Custom User Attribute Module

.. index:: Custom User Attribute Handler, Handler Modules


The custom user attribute handler module allows the adminitrator to set or delete
custom user attributes automatically. A specific event can thus set or delete
a custom user attribute without any further intervention of the administrator
or helpdesk. These custom user attributes can even be used in policies or user resolvers.

.. Note:: This event handler can also set attributes that can't be set or deleted manually
          by the administrator or the helpdesk users.


Possible Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

set_custom_user_attributes
..........................

This action sets a custom user attribute on a certain event.

The action takes the options `attrkey`, `attrvalue` and `user`.

`attrkey` and `attrvalue` can take fixed values. The custom user attribute `attrkey` will
then be set to the value of `attrvalue`.

With the option `user` the custom user attribute can either be set for the acting,
logged in user or for the user on whom the administrator is acting on.

For example if a user failed to login too many times, the eventhandler can automatically
set the custom attribute "this user has login problems".

delete_custom_user_attributes
.............................

This action deletes a custom user attribute on a certain event.

The action takes the options `attrkey` and `user` as described above.

For example you could set a custom user attribute on the token
enrollment process, that indicates, that this is a new user and
set a custom user attribute to "new user maybe needs help by the
first login". On the first successful login this custom user attribute
could be automatically deleted using this event handler.
